        My Dear Paithiyakari, BUBBLEeEEEEE!!!!
    </h1>

        Some people arrive quietly and change everything without asking!!!

        There was a moment I knew — not when it became perfect,
        but when I didn’t want to walk away, even if it wasn’t perfect yet.

        If I had to begin again,
        I’d still find you.

        <br><br>
        You came into my life as a stranger,
        without promises or expectations.
        I never believed much in love —
        I was the kind of person who kept my heart guarded.
        
        But somehow, you changed that.

        The way you looked at me —
        there was something honest in your eyes,
        something warm and real.

        You put in effort when you didn’t have to.
        You cared in ways that felt quiet, but meant everything.
        
        And without realizing it, you gave me hope.
        Today, we’re not just together —
        we’re choosing each other.
        And now, you are my love,
        my safest place,
        and my highest priority.

        UMMAaa... Love You SOOO muchhh DA THangooooo
